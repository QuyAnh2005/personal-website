# Vision Transformer for Medical Image Analysis

## Project Overview

This project implements a specialized Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture designed specifically for medical imaging tasks. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both segmentation and classification of radiological images across multiple modalities (MRI, CT, X-ray).

## Key Features

- **Multi-modal capability**: Single model can process different imaging modalities
- **3D support**: Extended transformer architecture to handle volumetric data
- **Attention visualization**: Tools to interpret the model's decision-making process
- **Memory efficiency**: Optimizations to reduce the computational requirements compared to standard ViT implementations

## Technical Implementation

The architecture builds on the original Vision Transformer but incorporates several medical imaging-specific modifications:

1. **Patch embedding with 3D convolutions** for volumetric data
2. **Multi-resolution processing** to capture details at different scales
3. **Anatomical attention bias** to incorporate prior knowledge of human anatomy
4. **Uncertainty estimation** through Monte Carlo dropout during inference

## Mathematical Foundation

The attention mechanism is at the core of the transformer architecture. For our medical imaging application, we modified the standard attention formula to incorporate anatomical priors:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T + A}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

Where $A$ is an anatomical bias matrix that encodes spatial relationships between different anatomical regions.

## Results

The model achieved the following results on public benchmarks:

| Task | Dataset | Metric | Performance |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Brain tumor segmentation | BraTS 2023 | Dice score | 0.92 |
| Lung lesion detection | LIDC-IDRI | AUC | 0.95 |
| Chest X-ray classification | CheXpert | F1 score | 0.88 |

## Future Work

Ongoing developments include:

- Integration with clinical workflows through DICOM support
- Reduced inference time for emergency care settings
- Self-supervised pre-training on larger unlabeled datasets
- Extension to pathology image analysis
