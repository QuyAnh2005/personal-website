As a researcher delving into the intricacies of machine learning (ML), I’ve always believed that true understanding comes from building things from the ground up. That’s why I’m excited to share insights from the "Homemade Machine Learning" project, an open-source initiative by Quy Anh Dang, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/QuyAnh2005/homemade-machine-learning). This project offers a collection of Jupyter notebooks that guide \n implement core ML algorithms from scratch, providing a practical, hands-on way to grasp the mechanics behind the models we often take for granted. Today, April 2, 2025, I’m presenting this as a cornerstone of my research website—a resource that bridges theory and practice for students, educators, and fellow researchers alike.

## What is Homemade Machine Learning?

"Homemade Machine Learning" is an educational endeavor designed to peel back the layers of machine learning algorithms. Its tagline, "Understand and code some basic algorithms in machine learning from scratch," encapsulates its mission. Through detailed Jupyter notebooks, it covers a wide array of topics—Linear Regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means Clustering, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—with plans for future additions like SVD, LDA, and DBSCAN. Each notebook not only provides code but also explains the underlying math and theory, making it a goldmine for anyone looking to deepen their ML knowledge.

## Setting Up the Environment

Getting started is straightforward. Clone the repository with:
```
git clone https://github.com/QuyAnh2005/homemade-machine-learning.git
```
You’ll need Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook installed, along with key libraries: NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data handling, Scikit-learn for comparisons, and Matplotlib for visualizations. Install them via:
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
Navigate to the project folder, launch Jupyter with `jupyter notebook`, and open any file—like `Linear Regression.ipynb`—to begin. It’s a low-barrier entry into a rich learning experience.

## Exploring the Content

The project is neatly categorized, offering a structured path through ML fundamentals. Here’s a closer look:

### Regression
- **Linear Regression**: Learn the Least Square Method, implement the model, and test it. It’s the perfect starting point for understanding predictive modeling.
- **Gradient Descent**: Dive into optimization with gradient formulas, weight updates, and practical implementation—key to training many ML models.
- **Cost Functions**: Explore cost definitions, partial derivatives, and gradient descent, tying theory to code.

### Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA**: Master variance preservation, principal components, and projection to lower dimensions, with a sklearn comparison. It’s a must-know for handling high-dimensional data.

### Clustering
- **K-means**: Understand the algorithm, its strengths and weaknesses, and code it from scratch, with a sklearn benchmark. Great for unsupervised learning basics.

### Classification
- **Decision Trees**: Tackle entropy, information gain, and the ID3 algorithm, plus CART cost functions—ideal for decision-making models.
- **SVMs**: From hard and soft margins to kernel tricks and dual formulations, this section is thorough and visual.
- **Naive Bayes**: Implement Gaussian and Multinomial versions, addressing out-of-vocabulary challenges—a staple for text classification.
- **Random Forest**: Build an ensemble with pseudo-code and weigh its pros and cons—powerful yet accessible.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Grasp ensemble theory and implementation, a technique behind top-tier models like XGBoost.

### Future Horizons
The project hints at upcoming topics—SVD for matrix factorization, LDA for supervised dimensionality reduction, and DBSCAN for density-based clustering—promising even more depth.

## Why It’s Valuable

This isn’t just code—it’s a learning companion. For students, it’s a way to see the math in action; for researchers like me, it’s a sandbox to tweak algorithms; for educators, it’s ready-made material. The notebooks often compare homemade implementations with Scikit-learn, offering a reality check on performance and accuracy. Plus, the visualizations—think decision boundaries or cluster plots—make abstract concepts tangible.

## Limitations and Considerations

No project is perfect. The lack of a formal `requirements.txt` means you’ll infer dependencies from the notebooks, which might trip up novices. The focus is on education, not production-grade code, so don’t expect optimized solutions. Still, these are minor trade-offs for the clarity and depth provided.

## My Take as a Researcher

As I build my personal website, "Homemade Machine Learning" fits perfectly into my mission to share knowledge and foster curiosity. It’s a resource I’ll link to, recommend in workshops, and use to prototype ideas. The project’s blend of theory, code, and visuals aligns with how I approach research—start with the basics, question everything, and build iteratively.

## Conclusion

"Homemade Machine Learning" is more than a GitHub repo—it’s a gateway to mastering ML by doing. Whether you’re a beginner coding your first regression or a seasoned researcher exploring ensemble methods, it’s worth a dive.
