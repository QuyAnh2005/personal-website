# A Comprehensive Survey of Reinforcement Learning Applications in Scientific Discovery

## Abstract

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex decision-making problems. This survey examines the growing role of RL in accelerating scientific discovery across chemistry, physics, biology, materials science, and astronomy. We analyze over 200 publications from 2018-2024, categorizing applications by scientific domain, type of RL algorithm, and discovery outcome. Our analysis reveals distinct patterns in how RL is being leveraged in different fields, common challenges encountered, and promising future directions. We also discuss the methodological adaptations required for applying RL to scientific problems, where constraints like experimental cost, safety considerations, and the need for explainability present unique challenges compared to traditional RL applications.

## Introduction

The scientific discovery process has traditionally relied on a combination of hypothesis-driven experimentation, theory development, and increasingly, data analysis. Reinforcement learning—a paradigm where agents learn optimal behaviors through interaction with an environment—offers a new approach to scientific discovery by framing it as a sequential decision-making process under uncertainty.

This survey comprehensively examines how RL is being applied across scientific domains to:

1. Optimize experimental design and protocols
2. Discover new materials, molecules, and compounds
3. Control complex scientific instruments and systems
4. Extract insights from massive scientific datasets
5. Guide theoretical investigations through intelligent exploration

## Methodology

We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed papers published between January 2018 and April 2024 across major scientific and machine learning venues. Our initial search yielded 478 papers, which were filtered based on relevance to scientific discovery applications, resulting in a final corpus of 203 papers for detailed analysis.

For each paper, we cataloged:
- Scientific domain and subdomain
- Type of RL algorithm (model-free, model-based, etc.)
- Problem formulation (states, actions, rewards)
- Integration with scientific workflows
- Reported results and impact
- Technical challenges and solutions

## Applications by Domain

### Chemistry and Drug Discovery

RL has been particularly successful in chemistry, with applications including:

- **Molecular Design**: Generating novel molecules with desired properties using RL to navigate chemical space
- **Synthesis Planning**: Determining efficient synthesis pathways for target compounds
- **Reaction Optimization**: Tuning reaction conditions to maximize yield and selectivity

The most common approaches use graph-based representations of molecules and employ techniques like proximal policy optimization (PPO) and deep Q-networks (DQN) with domain-specific rewards based on chemical properties.

### Materials Science

In materials science, RL has been applied to:

- **Alloy Design**: Discovering new metal alloys with optimal combinations of properties
- **Crystal Structure Prediction**: Identifying stable crystal structures for new materials
- **Manufacturing Process Optimization**: Tuning processing parameters for desired material properties

These applications often combine RL with physics-based simulators and high-throughput computational screening.

## Methodological Adaptations

Applying RL to scientific discovery requires several methodological adaptations:

### Reward Function Design

Scientific discovery problems often involve multiple competing objectives and constraints. Researchers have developed approaches including:

- Multi-objective RL with Pareto optimization
- Constraint satisfaction through penalty terms
- Uncertainty-aware rewards that balance exploration and exploitation

### Sample Efficiency

Given the high cost of scientific experiments, sample efficiency is critical. Common strategies include:

- Model-based RL to learn environment dynamics
- Transfer learning from simulations to real experiments
- Active learning to select the most informative experiments

### Mathematical Formulation

The scientific discovery process can be formalized as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by the tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}, \gamma)$, where:

- $\mathcal{S}$ is the state space representing scientific configurations or knowledge
- $\mathcal{A}$ is the action space representing possible experimental choices or interventions
- $\mathcal{P}$ is the transition probability function modeling scientific phenomena
- $\mathcal{R}$ is the reward function quantifying scientific progress or discovery value
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor balancing immediate versus long-term discoveries

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite promising results, several challenges remain:

1. **Interpretability**: Scientists require explanations for why specific actions are recommended
2. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Properly accounting for experimental and model uncertainties
3. **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Effectively combining scientific expertise with RL algorithms
4. **Long-horizon Discovery**: Managing the long time scales often required for scientific breakthroughs

Future directions include closer integration with scientific simulators, hybrid approaches combining RL with other machine learning paradigms, and the development of benchmark environments specifically for scientific discovery tasks.

## Conclusion

Reinforcement learning is emerging as a powerful tool for accelerating scientific discovery across multiple domains. While challenges remain, the rapid pace of methodological innovation in both RL algorithms and scientific applications suggests that these techniques will play an increasingly important role in how science is conducted in the coming decades. The most successful applications will likely come from close collaborations between domain scientists and RL researchers, combining scientific knowledge with algorithmic innovation.
